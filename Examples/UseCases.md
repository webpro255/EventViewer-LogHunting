## 2. Privilege Escalation Monitoring
### Scenario
A user account is granted higher privileges, potentially as part of a privilege escalation attack.

### Steps to Detect
- Go to **Windows Logs > Security**.
- Filter for **Event ID 4672** (special privileges assigned to a new logon).
- Identify any accounts that are granted privileged access outside of normal procedures.

### Actionable Steps
- Verify the authenticity of the account activity.
- Check if the accountâ€™s actions align with expected behavior.
- If unexpected, escalate the issue to security teams for further investigation.
